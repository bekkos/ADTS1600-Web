        <h1 class="title">The Smart Mask</h1>
        <p>
            Smart mask will come with a speaker on the right side and a microphone on the left side. 
            There will be a filter on the inside where you can take it off and on, to meet requirments 
            in hygiene and sanitation.
            After the covid-19 situation, we have seen the use of masks and the problems that come 
            from the use of masks. Our solution: The smart mask gives the user an easy way to 
            communicate with others while also minimizing your chance of getting infected. 
            The product is a simple-looking mask, with technological aspects that will change the 
            mask-game.
            Our main focus and desired outcome for the product we want to develop is that the 
            mask is user-friendly for everyone. Our top priority is safety for our users and 
            reusability are key for our product to succeed, therefore we will strive to ensure 
            that our product fulfil these requirements and such is our desirable outcome. 
            Today’s masks are suitable for a small part of the population. By customizing it, 
            more people will feel comfortable using one.

        <p>
            2020 has been marked by a pandemic. This pandemic has shown us that the need of good, safe and easy to use facemasks 
            is higher than ever before. As a society, we were caught off-guard and the pandemic shone light on the many problems 
            with today’s face-mask production and their lacking quality and ease of use. Our flagship product works to solve this 
            issue by allowing the user a much more comfortable and safe product which will allow for fluent communication and much 
            less risk of infection due to not having to remove the mask and/or touch your face. We will do this by giving the mask 
            a speaker and a mic inside so that you can easily communicate with one another. We also want to make it easy hygienically 
            to be able to change the inside of the mask without changing the whole mask. This is done by changing only the innermost 
            layers of the mask and keeping the outside of the mask. We want to make the mask more suitable for everyday life, while 
            still keeping it hygienic and minimize spreading the virus. We want to make the mask meet the users need for them to be 
            willing to wear it, by making it more wearable yet still comply the requirements of the government.
